  chapterTitle: Back to Teal
  composerName: Chester Wilde
  chapterInfo: A classic music taste combined with an intense love for videos games
    has led Wilde to craft a masterpiece of epic proportions. Fueled by aggression
    and hard liquor, <i>Back to Teal</i> brings back the music that used to play
    at<i>The Cellar Door</i> 50 years ago, and then reimagines it for the younger,
    thrillseeking generation.
