  chapterTitle: Reeds on the Sand
  composerName: Oliver "Teaspoon" Baskin
  chapterInfo: When his father couldn't fulfill his dream of becoming a famous rapper
    or producer, he settled into life coaching and settled down. Oliver discovered
    his innate talent in composition by accident when exploring the family attic
    and ever since has been writing music faster than Stephen King writes bestsellers.
    <i>Reeds on the Sand</i> is an homage to his roots, playfully created around
    a reggae/ska type beat that he wrote when on the bus one day.
